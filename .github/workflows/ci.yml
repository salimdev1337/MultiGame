# =============================================================================
# CI WORKFLOW - Continuous Integration
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE: This workflow runs automatically on every push and pull request
# to ensure code quality and catch bugs early.
#
# WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
# - How to trigger workflows automatically
# - Running tests in the cloud
# - Checking code quality
# - Caching dependencies for faster builds

# TRIGGER: When does this workflow run?
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master, develop ]  # Run on pushes to these branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master, develop ]  # Run on PRs to these branches
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual trigger from GitHub UI

# JOBS: The actual work to be done
jobs:
  # Job 1: Test the Flutter app
  test:
